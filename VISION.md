# What The Game - Product Vision

## 🎮 Overview

**What The Game** is a next-generation, AI-powered gaming companion that transforms how gamers interact with their game libraries. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technology and comprehensive gaming platform integrations, we're building an intelligent assistant that understands your gaming preferences, helps manage your backlog, and discovers your next favorite game.

## 🚀 Core Mission

To eliminate the paradox of choice in gaming by providing personalized, intelligent recommendations and insights that help gamers make the most of their gaming time.

## 💡 The Problem We're Solving

Modern gamers face several challenges:

1. **Library Overload**: Steam sales, bundle deals, and subscription services have led to massive game libraries with hundreds of unplayed titles
2. **Decision Paralysis**: Too many choices make it difficult to decide what to play next
3. **Fragmented Libraries**: Games spread across Steam, GOG, Epic, Xbox, PlayStation, etc.
4. **Lost Gems**: Great games get buried in backlogs and forgotten
5. **Time Management**: Limited gaming time means choices matter more
6. **Discovery Gap**: Recommendation systems are generic and don't understand individual play patterns

## 🎯 Our Solution

### Phase 1: Intelligent Library Aggregation
- **Unified Library View**: See all your games from Steam, GOG, Epic, Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation, and more in one place
- **Smart Deduplication**: Automatically identify games you own across multiple platforms
- **Rich Metadata**: Enhanced game information including reviews, playtime estimates, difficulty ratings
- **Cross-Platform Tracking**: Track progress regardless of where you play

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Intelligence

#### Natural Language Game Discovery
```
User: "Find me a cozy game like Stardew Valley but with more combat"
AI: "Based on your request, I recommend Rune Factory 5. It combines farming 
     simulation with action RPG combat, similar to Stardew but with dungeon 
     crawling and monster battles."
```

#### Contextual Recommendations
- **Mood-Based**: "What should I play when I'm stressed?"
- **Time-Based**: "I have 30 minutes, what can I play?"

#### Conversational Game Assistant
```
User: "Why did you recommend Hollow Knight?"
AI: "You've completed Celeste and Dead Cells with high ratings, both 
     challenging platformers. Hollow Knight matches this difficulty preference
     while adding Metroidvania exploration you enjoyed in Ori. Your average
     session length of 2 hours fits its gameplay loop perfectly."

     Dragon's Dogma 2 (40 hours invested) and historically don't play two 
     100+ hour RPGs simultaneously. You abandoned Divinity: Original Sin 2 
     under similar circumstances. Optimal start time: 3 weeks."
