## 🤖 AI-Powered Features

### Natural Language Understanding

#### Semantic Game Search
```
"Find me a game like Dark Souls but sci-fi"
"Games with great soundtracks"
"Cozy games I can play while listening to podcasts"
"Short games I can complete this weekend"
"Games that made people cry"
```

**Implementation**: Use embeddings and semantic search to go beyond simple tag matching

#### Conversational Recommendations
```
User: "I'm feeling stressed after work"
AI: "I notice you prefer relaxing games when stressed. How about 
     Unpacking or A Short Hike? Both are calming and completable 
     in one sitting."
     
User: "Something with a bit more action"
AI: "Try Hades then - it has action but in digestible runs. You 
     typically play it for 30-40 minutes, perfect for decompressing."
```

**Implementation**: Multi-turn conversation with context retention, analyzing user patterns

#### Why This Recommendation?
Every recommendation comes with a detailed explanation:
- "You completed similar games with 4+ stars"
- "Similar to games you've wishlisted"
- "92% of players with your profile loved this"
- "Perfect length for your typical session (1-2 hours)"
- "On sale now - saves you $15 vs your wishlist average"

### Predictive Intelligence

#### Completion Probability
"You have an 87% chance of completing this game based on:
- Genre match (you complete 94% of roguelikes)
- Length (15 hours fits your sweet spot)
- Difficulty (challenging but fair, your preference)
- Currently trending in your friend group"

#### Play Time Prediction
"Based on your playstyle:
- Main story: 18 hours (vs 15 avg)
- Completionist: 45 hours (vs 35 avg)
- You'll likely explore 87% of optional content"

#### Optimal Start Time
"Don't start Baldur's Gate 3 now because:
- You're 40 hours into Elden Ring
- You historically abandon 100+ hour RPGs when playing two simultaneously
- BG3 DLC releases in 2 months - better to wait
- Optimal start: March 15th based on your schedule"

#### Burnout Detection
"You've played 35 hours of roguelikes this week. Consider trying:
- Something narrative-focused (you're due for story)
- Lower difficulty (prevent frustration)
- Different visual style (avoid fatigue)"

### Social Intelligence

- Skill level matching
- Play schedule overlap
- Communication style (competitive vs casual)

#### Group Game Night Optimizer
"For your party of 4 players, I recommend:
1. Overcooked 2 (all own, quick sessions, skill-matched)
2. Phasmophobia (you enjoy co-op horror, Amy's request honored)
3. Golf With Your Friends (palette cleanser, low stakes)"

#### Influencer/Streamer Matching
"Your taste aligns 94% with content creator 'GamingCouch' - here are games they loved that you haven't played yet."

### Review & Sentiment Analysis

Instead of reading 10,000 reviews:
- "Combat: Universally praised (96% positive)"
- "Story: Divisive - linear vs open-world debate"
- "Technical: Launch issues resolved in patch 1.3"
- "Length: Too short according to 40% of players"
- "For you: Story criticism doesn't apply - you prefer tight narratives"

#### Controversy Detection
"This game is polarizing because:
- Art style (love it or hate it)
- Difficulty (no difficulty options)
- Ending (45% found it unsatisfying)
- Your likely reaction: You'll appreciate the challenge"

#### Review Time Analysis
"Recent reviews (last 30 days): 87% positive (up from 62% at launch)
Major improvements: bug fixes, QoL features, content additions
Safe to play now if you waited for fixes."

#### Personal Review Weighting
"Standard Metacritic: 82/100
For YOU: 91/100 because:
- Reviewers who disliked it prefer action (you prefer puzzle)
